# Telegram-UserBot

[![Build Status](https://semaphoreci.com/api/v1/baalajimaestro/telegram-userbot/branches/non-sql/badge.svg)](https://semaphoreci.com/baalajimaestro/telegram-userbot)

### If the semaphore build passed, but you still get syntax errors when running locally it's most probably not a problem with the source but with your version of python

```diff
- #include <std/disclaimer.h>

- Your Telegram account may get banned.
- I am not responsible for any improper use of this bot
- This bot is intended for the purpose of having fun with memes
- as well as efficiently managing groups
- You ended up spamming groups, getting reported left and right,
 and the Telegram Team deleted your account?
- And then you pointed your fingers at me for getting yourself reported?
- I will laugh at you.

## Dependencies:

- SQL DB, can be Postgres/MySQL or anything else supported by SQLAlchemy

- Neofetch (in case you need `sysdetails`)

### Before you start:
Get your api-id (called `API_KEY` in this bot) and API_HASH from my.telegram.org.


Optional: Create an empty group, add Marie, or any forks, get the group id, copy it and set it as your `LOGGER` (in case you want logging).


**Carfully read this entire guide before cloning so you don't end up getting stuck. When followed properly you'll end up with your userbot up and running after following it.**

#### Running on Heroku:
1. **Make sure to generate a session file, by running app.py on your local pc before deploying it on Heroku.**
- Fork this repo.
- Download/Clone it to your Linux PC, then follow the instructions on running on Linux below, to generate a userbot.session file, which is needed to run your bot.
> **A session is a key to your Telegram account, pushing it to GitHub will grant any person full access to your Telegram account.
You must be extra careful when pushing to GitHub. The gitignore in this repository should prevent this from happening in most cases, but you should still keep this in mind to prevent any fatal consequences.**
- You can choose bleeding edge builds which might be buggy, otherwise choose a release tags.
- If you use a bleeding edge, your bot version will be `b`
- Push it with the heroku cli
- Deploy.

- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/baalajimaestro/Telegram-UserBot`
- Install all dependencies after moving to the project directory by running: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
- Configure your bot in `config.py` (You can use `sample_config.py` as a reference when doing so)
  - Remove the warning from sample_config, it is to prevent simple renaming and running
